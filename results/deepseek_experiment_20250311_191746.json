            "prompt": "</think>\n\nTo address the problem of determining whether a given integer \\( n \\) is a prime number, we'll implement an optimized and efficient solution. Here's the refined approach:\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Checks for Small Values**:\n   - Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.\n   - The numbers 2 and 3 are prime.\n\n2. **Eliminate Even Numbers Quickly**:\n   - Any even number greater than 2 is not prime.\n\n3. **Efficient Divisor Checking**:\n   - Check divisibility starting from 5 up to the square root of \\( n \\).\n   - Increment in steps of 6 (checking both \\( i \\) and \\( i + 2 \\)) to skip unnecessary checks.\n\nThis method reduces the number of iterations needed, improving efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if a given integer n is a prime number.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        n (int): The integer to check for primality.\n        \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if n is a prime number, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    i = 5\n    w = 2\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += w\n        w = 6 - w  # Alternate between adding 2 and 4 (checks 5,7,11,13,...)\n    \n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Edge Cases Handling**: The function quickly handles small values and even numbers, ensuring immediate results without unnecessary computations.\n- **Efficient Loop**: By iterating up to the square root of \\( n \\) and skipping non-prime candidates efficiently, the function minimizes the number of checks, enhancing performance.\n- **Readability and Documentation**: The code includes clear comments and a docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value, making it easy to understand and maintain.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is both efficient and easy to read, handling all edge cases appropriately.",
            "solution": "Okay, I need to determine if a given integer n is a prime number. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. So, any number less than or equal to 1 isn't prime. That's straightforward.\n\nWhat about the smallest primes? Oh right, 2 and 3 are primes. But wait, 2 is the only even prime. So if n is even and greater than 2, it can't be prime. That gives me some quick checks at the beginning.\n\nSo my plan is:\n1. If n is less than or equal to 1, return False.\n2. If n is 2 or 3, return True.\n3. If n is divisible by 2 or 3, return False because those aren't primes beyond themselves.\n\nNow, for numbers larger than 3, I need a more efficient way to check for factors. I recall that checking up to the square root of n is sufficient because if n has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding smaller factor would have already been found.\n\nBut instead of checking every single number up to sqrt(n), which could be slow for large n, maybe there's a smarter way. I remember something about checking in increments of 6. Let me think: after 2 and 3, all primes are of the form 6k ± 1. So perhaps I can start checking from 5 upwards, incrementing by 6 each time, but also checking the next odd number each step.\n\nWait, so starting at 5, I check 5 and then 7 (which is 5+2). Then add 4 to get to 11, then 13, etc. This way, I'm skipping multiples of 2 and 3, which should reduce the number of checks significantly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n- Initialize i to 5.\n- Use a loop where i goes up to sqrt(n).\n- In each iteration, check if n is divisible by i. If yes, return False.\n- Then, increment i by 2 (to get to 7), then by 4 (to get to 11), alternating between adding 2 and 4. Wait, actually, another way is to alternate the step size between 2 and 4. Or perhaps use a variable 'w' that alternates between 2 and ",

A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. The goal is to efficiently check for primality while handling edge cases and ensuring readability.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves several key steps to ensure efficiency and correctness:\n\n1. **Immediate Checks**: \n   - If \\( n \\) is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.\n   - If \\( n \\) is 2 or 3, it is prime.\n   - If \\( n \\) is divisible by 2 or 3, it is not prime.\n\n2. **Efficient Factor Checking**:\n   - Instead of checking all numbers up to \\( n \\), we only need to check up to the square root of \\( n \\) because a larger factor would have a corresponding smaller factor.\n   - To further optimize, we leverage the fact that all primes greater than 3 can be written in the form \\( 6k \\pm 1 \\). Thus, we check potential factors starting from 5, incrementing by 6 each time, and also check the subsequent odd number (e.g., 5 and 7).\n\nThis method reduces the number of checks needed, making the algorithm more efficient, especially for larger values of \\( n \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine if a given integer n is a prime number.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        n (int): The integer to check for primality.\n        \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if n is a prime number, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle base cases\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    elif n <= 3:\n        return True\n    elif n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check for factors from 5 up to sqrt(n)\n    i = 5\n    w = 2  # Increment alternates between 2 and 4 (total 6)\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += w\n        w = 6 - w  # Alternate between 2 and 4\n    \n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Base Cases**: The function immediately handles small values and obvious non-primes (even numbers",
