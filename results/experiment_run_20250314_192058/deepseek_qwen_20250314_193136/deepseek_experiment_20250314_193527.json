A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The function should efficiently handle both small and large numbers, including edge cases such as negative numbers, zero, and one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Handle Edge Cases**: \n   - If \\( n \\) is less than or equal to 1, it is not a prime number.\n   - If \\( n \\) is exactly 2 or 3, it is a prime number.\n   - If \\( n \\) is even (i.e., divisible by 2), it is not a prime number.\n\n2. **Check Divisors Efficiently**:\n   - For numbers greater than 3, check divisibility starting from the smallest odd divisor up to the square root of \\( n \\). This reduces the number of checks significantly compared to checking all possible divisors up to \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Optimization**:\n   - By iterating only through odd numbers starting from 3, we can further reduce the number of iterations needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine if a given integer n is a prime number.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        n (int): The integer to check for primality.\n        \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if n is a prime number, False otherwise.\n        \n    Examples:\n        >>> is_prime(7)\n        True\n        >>> is_prime(10)\n        False\n        >>> is_prime(1)\n        False\n        >>> is_prime(0)\n        False\n        >>> is_prime(-5)\n        False\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check for non-positive integers, 0, 1, and even numbers >2\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Only check for factors up to sqrt(n), stepping by 2 to skip even numbers\n    max_divisor = int(n ** 0.5) + 1\n    for d in range(3, max_divisor, 2):\n        if n % d == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Edge Case Handling**: The function immediately returns `False` for any input less than or equal to ",

            "solution": "Okay, so I need to write a Python function called is_prime that determines whether a given integer is a prime number. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, what defines a prime number? Oh right, a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, numbers like 2, 3, 5, etc., are primes. But wait, 1 isn't considered a prime, nor are negative numbers.\n\nSo, my function needs to handle various edge cases. Let me list them out:\n\n1. If n is less than or equal to 1, return False because those aren't primes.\n2. If n is exactly 2, return True since 2 is the smallest and only even prime.\n3. If n is any other even number, return False because they can be divided by 2.\n\nOnce those edge cases are handled, I need to check for divisibility by odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of n. Why the square root? Because if n has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding divisor would be smaller than the square root, which we've already checked.\n\nWait, but why start at 3? Well, because we've already ruled out even numbers, so checking every second number (i.e., odd numbers) will cover all possible divisors without redundancy.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Check if n is less than or equal to 1 → return False.\n- Check if n is 2 → return True.\n- Check if n is even → return False.\n- Calculate the maximum divisor to check, which is the square root of n plus one.\n- Loop through all odd numbers starting from 3 up to max_divisor.\n- For each divisor, check if it divides n evenly. If yes, return False.\n- If none of the divisors divide n, then return True.\n\nNow, thinking about the loop structure. Using a for loop with a step of 2 makes sense here. Starting at 3, going up to max_divisor, stepping by 2 each time.\n\nWhat about some test cases?\n\nTest case 1: n=7\nIt should return True because 7 is a prime.\n\nTest case 2: n=15\nDivisible by 3 and 5, so return False.\n\nTest case 3: n=2\nReturn True.\n\nTest case 4: n=-3\nNegative, so",
