A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The function should efficiently handle both small and large numbers while adhering to the constraints provided.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Handle Edge Cases**: \n   - If \\( n \\) is less than or equal to 1, it is not a prime number.\n   - If \\( n \\) is exactly 2, it is the smallest and only even prime number.\n   \n2. **Check for Even Numbers**:\n   - Any even number greater than 2 cannot be prime since it will be divisible by 2.\n\n3. **Efficient Prime Checking**:\n   - For odd numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 3 up to the square root of \\( n \\). This reduces the number of checks significantly compared to checking all numbers up to \\( n \\).\n   - Increment the divisor by 2 in each step to skip even numbers, further optimizing the process.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a number is prime.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        n (int): The number to check for primality.\n        \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if n is a prime number, False otherwise.\n        \n    Examples:\n        >>> is_prime(7)\n        True\n        >>> is_prime(10)\n        False\n        >>> is_prime(1)\n        False\n        >>> is_prime(0)\n        False\n        >>> is_prime(-5)\n        False\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle edge cases\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    elif n == 2:\n        return True\n    elif n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check for factors from 3 up to sqrt(n), stepping by 2\n    max_divisor = int(n ** 0.5) + 1\n    for d in range(3, max_divisor, 2):\n        if n % d == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Edge Cases Handling**: The function immediately returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1, and correctly identifies 2 as prime.\n- **Even Number Check**: By returning `False` for any even number greater than 2, we eliminate half of",

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, for example, 2 is prime, 3 is prime, but 4 isn't because it can be divided by 2.\n\nFirst, I should handle some edge cases. If the input number n is less than or equal to 1, then it's definitely not prime. That makes sense because primes are greater than 1. So, my first condition will check if n <= 1 and return False immediately.\n\nNext, what about when n is exactly 2? Well, 2 is the smallest prime number, so in that case, the function should return True. So I'll add an elif condition for n == 2 returning True.\n\nThen, if n is even and greater than 2, like 4, 6, etc., those aren't prime either because they're divisible by 2.

For odd numbers greater than 2, we need to check if they have any divisors other than 1 and themselves. To do this efficiently, instead of checking all numbers up to n-1, which would be slow for large n, we only need to check up to the square root of n. This is because if n has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding divisor would be smaller than the square root, and we would have already found it.\n\nSo, I'll calculate the maximum divisor to check as the integer value of the square root of n plus one. This ensures that we cover all possible factors without going overboard.\n\nThen, I'll loop through all odd numbers starting from 3 up to max_divisor, incrementing by 2 each time. For each divisor d, I'll check if n is divisible by d. If it is, then n isn't prime, so return False.\n\nIf none of the divisors divide n evenly, then after the loop completes, we can conclude that n is prime and return True.\n\nLet me also think about the efficiency here. By checking only up to sqrt(n), we significantly reduce the number of iterations needed, especially for large numbers. Also, skipping even numbers after checking for 2 helps cut down on",

            "solution": "Okay, so I need to write a Python function called is_prime that checks if a given integer is a prime number. Hmm, let me think about how primes work. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, first, I should handle some edge cases.\n\nWait, what if someone passes a number less than or equal to 1? Those aren't primes, right? So I should immediately return False for those. Then there's the case when n is exactly 2. Oh yeah, 2 is the only even prime number, so I should return True for that.\n\nWhat about even numbers larger than 2? Like 4, 6, etc.? They can't be primes because they're divisible by 2. So after checking for 2, I can check if n is even and return False if it is.\n\nNow, for the actual prime checking part. Instead of checking all numbers up to n-1, which would be inefficient, especially for large numbers, I remember that we only need to check up to the square root of n. Because if n has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding divisor would be smaller than the square root, and we'd have already found it.\n\nSo, I'll calculate the maximum divisor as the integer part of the square root of n plus one. That way, I cover all possible divisors without going over.\n\nBut wait, do I need to check every number up to that point? No, actually, once I've checked 2, I can skip all even numbers. So starting from 3, I'll check every odd number up to max_divisor. If any of them divide n evenly, then n isn't prime.\n\nPutting this all together, here's how the function might look:\n\nFirst, handle the edge cases. If n is less than or equal to 1, return False. If n is 2, return True. If n is even, return False.\n\nThen, loop through odd numbers starting at 3 up to max_divisor. For each d, check if n mod d is zero. If yes, return False because it's not prime.\n\nIf none of the divisors work, then n is prime, so return True.\n\nI also need to make sure the function is properly documented. Adding a docstring that explains what the function does, the parameter it takes, and what it returns will help anyone reading the code understand it better.\n\nLet me double",
