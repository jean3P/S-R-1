The problem expects the final array to have the same elements as the initial array, but with the k operations applied, maintaining the original positions except for the selected min elements.\n        # Oh, this complicates things. The initial approach using a heap may not capture the correct positions because the heap doesn't track the original indices.\n        # So, we need a different approach. Instead of using a heap, we can track the minimum elements along with their indices, but for large k, this would be inefficient.\n        # Alternative approach: Since each operation affects the smallest element, and after each multiplication, the element may no longer be the smallest. So, for each step, we need to find the current smallest element in the array.\n        # But for large k (up to 1e9), iterating k times is not feasible. So, we need a more efficient approach.\n        # Let's think differently. Each operation affects the smallest element. After each multiplication, the element could become larger or smaller, depending on the multiplier. But since the multiplier is at least 1, the element will not become smaller than before.\n        # Wait, no. If the multiplier is 1, the element remains the same. If it's greater than 1, it increases. So, once an element is multiplied, it's no longer the smallest unless all other elements are larger.\n        # So, the first k operations will target the same element if it's the smallest and the multiplier is 1. Otherwise, each operation may target a different element.\n        # Hmm, this suggests that for large k, we can't simulate each step. We need a mathematical approach to find how many times each element is multiplied.\n        # Let's consider that each element can be multiplied multiple times, but the order in which they are chosen depends on their current value.\n        # This seems complex. Perhaps, for the problem constraints, a simulation approach with a priority queue is manageable, but for k up to 1e9, it's not feasible.\n        # Wait, the constraints say k can be up to 1e9, which makes a simulation approach with O(k log n) time infeasible for large n and k.\n        # So, we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the process:\n        # Each operation selects the current minimum element and multiplies it by the multiplier. After each multiplication, the element's value increases (if multiplier > 1) or remains the same (if multiplier = 1).\n        # So, once an element is multiplied, it's no longer the minimum unless all other elements are larger.\n        # Therefore, the first few operations will target the same element until it's no longer the minimum.\n        # For example, in the first example, the initial array is [2,1,3,5,6]. The first operation targets 1, turning it into 2. Now the array is [2,2,3,5,6]. The next operation targets the first 2, turning it into 4. Then the next operation targets the second 2, turning it into 4, and so on.\n        # So, the process can be broken down into phases where each phase consists of multiplying the same element multiple times until it's no longer the minimum.\n        # To model this, we can track for each element how many times it will be multiplied before it's no longer the minimum.\n        # However, this seems complicated, especially when elements have the same value.\n        # Another idea: Since each operation increases the value of the selected element (assuming multiplier > 1), the same element can be selected multiple times in a row until another element becomes smaller.\n        # So, for each element, we can calculate how many times it will be selected in a row before another element becomes the new minimum.\n        # But this requires comparing the current element's value after each multiplication with the next smallest element.\n        # Let's formalize this:\n        # Suppose we have a list of elements sorted in increasing order. The smallest element is x. After multiplying it m times, it becomes x * (multiplier)^m. We need to find the maximum m such that x * (multiplier)^m is still the smallest element.\n        # The next smallest element is y. We need to find m such that x * (multiplier)^m < y.\n        # Solving for m: m < log_y (y / x) / log_y (multiplier). Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute m as the maximum number of times we can multiply x before it becomes >= y.\n        # So, m is the largest integer where x * (multiplier)^m < y.\n        # Once we find m, we can apply all m operations to x, increasing it by multiplier each time, and then proceed to the next smallest element.\n        # This approach can significantly reduce the number of operations, especially when k is large.\n        # Let's try to implement this approach.\n        # First, we need to sort the elements and track their counts.\n        # Wait, but the array may have duplicates. So, we need to consider all occurrences of the minimum value.\n        # For example, if the array is [1,1,2], the first operation can choose either 1, but according to the problem statement, we choose the first occurrence. However, after multiplying, the array becomes [2,1,2], and the next minimum is the second 1.\n        # So, the selection order depends on the original indices, which complicates things.\n        # Therefore, perhaps the initial approach of using a priority queue is not sufficient because it doesn't track the original indices, and thus can't correctly handle cases where multiple elements have the same value.\n        # So, to handle this correctly, we need to track not just the values but also their original indices to determine which one is the first occurrence when multiple minima exist.\n        # This suggests that each element in the priority queue should be a tuple of (value, index), so that when values are equal, the one with the smaller index is selected first.\n        # However, even with this, for large k, the simulation approach may not be efficient enough.\n        # Given the problem constraints (k up to 1e9), we need a more efficient approach.\n        # Let's think again: each operation increases the value of the selected element. So, once an element is selected, it's possible that it will not be selected again unless all other elements are larger.\n        # So, the number of times an element can be selected is limited. For example, if the multiplier is 2, an element can be selected at most log2(y/x) times before it becomes larger than the next smallest element.\n        # Therefore, the total number of distinct elements that can be selected is O(n), and for each, the number of times it's selected is O(log(max_value)), which is manageable even for large k.\n        # So, the plan is:\n        1. Sort the elements along with their original indices.\n        2. For each element in the sorted list, determine how many times it can be selected before it's no longer the minimum.\n        3. For each such element, calculate the maximum number of operations m that can be applied to it without exceeding the next smallest element.\n        4. Apply as many operations as possible (up to m or remaining k) to this element, updating its value and reducing k accordingly.\n        5. Repeat until k becomes zero.\n        6. After all operations, apply the modulo to each element and return the array in the original order.\n        # However, this approach requires careful handling of the elements and their order, especially when multiple elements have the same value.\n        # Let's try to implement this.\n        # First, we need to sort the elements along with their indices, but in a way that when values are equal, the one with the smaller index comes first.\n        # Then, for each element in this sorted list, we calculate how many times it can be multiplied before it's no longer the minimum.\n        # Let's proceed step by step.\n        # Create a list of tuples (value, index) sorted by value and then by index.\n        sorted_elements = sorted([(val, idx) for idx, val in enumerate(nums)], key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n        # Now, we'll process each element in this sorted order.\n        current_k = k\n        for i in range(len(sorted_elements)):\n            current_val, current_idx = sorted_elements[i]\n            if current_k == 0:\n                break\n            # Find the next smallest value\n            if i < len(sorted_elements) - 1:\n                next_val, next_idx = sorted_elements[i+1]\n            else:\n                next_val = float('inf')\n            # Calculate how many times we can multiply current_val before it becomes >= next_val\n            # We need to find the maximum m where current_val * (multiplier)^m < next_val\n            # If multiplier is 1, then current_val remains the same.

The problem expects the final array to have the same elements as the initial array, but with the k operations applied, maintaining the original positions except for the selected min elements.\n        # Oh, this complicates things. The initial approach using a heap may not capture the correct positions because the heap doesn't track the original indices.\n        # So, we need a different approach. Instead of using a heap, we can track the minimum elements along with their indices, but for large k, this would be inefficient.\n        # Alternative approach: Since each operation affects the smallest element, and after each multiplication, the element may no longer be the smallest. So, for each step, we need to find the current smallest element in the array.\n        # But for large k (up to 1e9), iterating k times is not feasible. So, we need a more efficient approach.\n        # Let's think differently. Each operation affects the smallest element. After each multiplication, the element could become larger or smaller, depending on the multiplier. But since the multiplier is at least 1, the element will not become smaller than before.\n        # Wait, no. If the multiplier is 1, the element remains the same. If it's greater than 1, it increases. So, once an element is multiplied, it's no longer the smallest unless all other elements are larger.\n        # So, the first k operations will target the same element if it's the smallest and the multiplier is 1. Otherwise, each operation may target a different element.\n        # Hmm, this suggests that for large k, we can't simulate each step. We need a mathematical approach to find how many times each element is multiplied.\n        # Let's consider that each element can be multiplied multiple times, but the order in which they are chosen depends on their current value.\n        # This seems complex. Perhaps, for the problem constraints, a simulation approach with a priority queue is manageable, but for k up to 1e9, it's not feasible.\n        # Wait, the constraints say k can be up to 1e9, which makes a simulation approach with O(k log n) time infeasible for large n and k.\n        # So, we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the process:\n        # Each operation selects the current minimum element and multiplies it by the multiplier. After each multiplication, the element's value increases (if multiplier > 1) or remains the same (if multiplier = 1).\n        # So, once an element is multiplied, it's no longer the minimum unless all other elements are larger.\n        # Therefore, the first few operations will target the same element until it's no longer the minimum.\n        # For example, in the first example, the initial array is [2,1,3,5,6]. The first operation targets 1, turning it into 2. Now the array is [2,2,3,5,6]. The next operation targets the first 2, turning it into 4. Then the next operation targets the second 2, turning it into 4, and so on.\n        # So, the process can be broken down into phases where each phase consists of multiplying the same element multiple times until it's no longer the minimum.\n        # To model this, we can track for each element how many times it will be multiplied before it's no longer the minimum.\n        # However, this seems complicated, especially when elements have the same value.\n        # Another idea: Since each operation increases the value of the selected element (assuming multiplier > 1), the same element can be selected multiple times in a row until another element becomes smaller.\n        # So, for each element, we can calculate how many times it will be selected in a row before another element becomes the new minimum.\n        # But this requires comparing the current element's value after each multiplication with the next smallest element.\n        # Let's formalize this:\n        # Suppose we have a list of elements sorted in increasing order. The smallest element is x. After multiplying it m times, it becomes x * (multiplier)^m. We need to find the maximum m such that x * (multiplier)^m is still the smallest element.\n        # The next smallest element is y. We need to find m such that x * (multiplier)^m < y.\n        # Solving for m: m < log_y (y / x) / log_y (multiplier). Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute m as the maximum number of times we can multiply x before it becomes >= y.\n        # So, m is the largest integer where x * (multiplier)^m < y.\n        # Once we find m, we can apply all m operations to x, increasing it by multiplier each time, and then proceed to the next smallest element.\n        # This approach can significantly reduce the number of operations, especially when k is large.\n        # Let's try to implement this approach.\n        # First, we need to sort the elements and track their counts.\n        # Wait, but the array may have duplicates. So, we need to consider all occurrences of the minimum value.\n        # For example, if the array is [1,1,2], the first operation can choose either 1, but according to the problem statement, we choose the first occurrence. However, after multiplying, the array becomes [2,1,2], and the next minimum is the second 1.\n        # So, the selection order depends on the original indices, which complicates things.\n        # Therefore, perhaps the initial approach of using a priority queue is not sufficient because it doesn't track the original indices, and thus can't correctly handle cases where multiple elements have the same value.\n        # So, to handle this correctly, we need to track not just the values but also their original indices to determine which one is the first occurrence when multiple minima exist.\n        # This suggests that each element in the priority queue should be a tuple of (value, index), so that when values are equal, the one with the smaller index is selected first.\n        # However, even with this, for large k, the simulation approach may not be efficient enough.\n        # Given the problem constraints (k up to 1e9), we need a more efficient approach.\n        # Let's think again: each operation increases the value of the selected element. So, once an element is selected, it's possible that it will not be selected again unless all other elements are larger.\n        # So, the number of times an element can be selected is limited. For example, if the multiplier is 2, an element can be selected at most log2(y/x) times before it becomes larger than the next smallest element.\n        # Therefore, the total number of distinct elements that can be selected is O(n), and for each, the number of times it's selected is O(log(max_value)), which is manageable even for large k.\n        # So, the plan is:\n        1. Sort the elements along with their original indices.\n        2. For each element in the sorted list, determine how many times it can be selected before it's no longer the minimum.\n        3.
