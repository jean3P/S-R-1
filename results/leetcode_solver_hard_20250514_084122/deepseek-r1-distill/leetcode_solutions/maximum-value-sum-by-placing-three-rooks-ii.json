    "</think>\n\n## Problem Analysis\nThe problem requires placing three rooks on a chessboard such that they do not attack each other, meaning no two rooks can be in the same row or column. The goal is to maximize the sum of the values of the cells where the rooks are placed.\n\n## Solution Approach\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we can use a dynamic programming approach combined with precomputing the maximum values for each row and column. The steps are as follows:\n1. Precompute the maximum values for each row and their respective columns.\n2. Precompute the maximum values for each column and their respective rows.\n3. Use dynamic programming to track the best sums for placing 1, 2, or 3 rooks, ensuring no two are in the same row or column.\n4. Iterate through all possible valid configurations to find the maximum sum.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all valid configurations without redundant calculations.\n\n## Code Solution",

The goal is to maximize the sum of the values of the cells where the rooks are placed.\n\n## Solution Approach\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we can use a dynamic programming approach combined with precomputing the maximum values for each row and column. The steps are as follows:\n1. Precompute the maximum values for each row and their respective columns.\n2. Precompute the maximum values for each column and their respective rows.\n3. Use dynamic programming to track the best sums for placing 1, 2, or 3 rooks, ensuring no two are in the same row or column.\n4. Iterate through all possible valid configurations to find the maximum sum.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all valid configurations without redundant calculations.\n\n## Code Solution",
