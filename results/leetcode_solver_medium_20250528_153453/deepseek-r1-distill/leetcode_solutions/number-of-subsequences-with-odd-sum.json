Because when you include the odd number, it flips the parity. So, the new even count is the previous odd count (since adding the odd number to those gives even), and the new odd count is the previous even count (since adding the odd number to those gives odd). But also, each existing subsequence can choose to include or exclude the current number. So, the total is:\n                # new_even = even (exclude) + odd (include, which flips to even)\n                # new_odd = odd (exclude) + even (include, which flips to odd)\n                # Wait, that makes sense.

That can't be right because it would mean that after processing an odd number, the counts are the same, which isn't correct.\n                # I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's look for a pattern or mathematical approach.\n                # Let's consider that the total number of subsequences is 2^n, where n is the length of the array. But we need only those with odd sum.\n                # The number of such subsequences can be calculated based on the count of odd numbers in the array.\n                # Let's denote the number of odd elements as k.\n                # If k is zero, there are no odd-sum subsequences.\n                # If k is at least one, the number of odd-sum subsequences is (2^(n-1)) if the sum of all elements is odd, but that's not necessarily the case.\n                # Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each odd number can be included or not, and the sum's parity depends on the number of odd numbers included.\n                # So, the total number of subsequences with odd sum is equal to the sum over all subsets of the array where the subset contains an odd number of odd elements.\n                # So, if there are k odd numbers in the array, the number of such subsets is (2^{k-1}) * (2^{m}), where m is the number of even numbers. Because for each even number, it can be included or not, and for the odd numbers, we need to choose an odd number of them. The number of ways to choose an odd number of k elements is 2^{k-1}.\n                # So, the formula is: if k == 0, 0.

So 2^{3-1} * 2^0 = 4, which matches the example.\n                # In the second example, nums = [1,2,2], k=1, m=2. So 2^{1-1} * 2^2 = 1 *4=4, which matches the example.\n                # So, the general formula is: if there are zero odd numbers, return 0.

What about the new subsequence consisting of just the current number?\n                # Oh right, because the initial state includes the empty subsequence, which has even sum (0). So, when we process the first odd number, the even count becomes 1 (the empty subsequence plus the current number, which is odd, making the sum odd, but wait no: the empty subsequence is even, adding the current odd number makes it odd. So the new odd count would be 1 (the empty subsequence plus current number). But in our initial state, even is 1 and odd is 0. So after processing the first odd number, even becomes 0 and odd becomes 1. But wait, that's not correct because the empty subsequence is even, and the current number can be included or not. So the new even count is the previous even (not including current) plus the previous odd (including current, which flips parity). Similarly for odd.\n                # So, the correct update is:\n                new_even = (even + odd) % MOD\n                new_odd = (even + odd) % MOD\n                # Wait, that can't be right because it would double the counts. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n                # Let's think differently. For each number, whether even or odd, the total number of subsequences doubles (each existing subsequence can include or exclude the new number). But for the sum's parity, it depends on the number's parity.\n                # So, for an even number:\n                # The number of even subsequences becomes even * 2 (since adding even doesn't change parity)\n                # The number of odd subsequences remains the same.\n                # For an odd number:\n                # The number of even subsequences becomes the previous odd count (since adding odd to odd gives even)\n                # The number of odd subsequences becomes the previous even count (since adding odd to even gives odd)\n                # But wait, this is only considering adding the current number to existing subsequences. What about the new subsequence that is just the current number?\n                # Because the empty subsequence is included in 'even', when we process an odd number, adding it to the empty subsequence creates a new odd subsequence.\n                # So, the correct approach is:\n                # For each number:\n                # If even:\n                #     even = even * 2\n                #     odd = odd * 2\n                # If odd:\n                #     new_even = odd\n                #     new_odd = even\n                #     even, odd = new_even, new_odd\n                # But wait, that's not considering that each existing subsequence can choose to include or exclude the current number.\n                # So, perhaps the correct way is:\n                # For even numbers:\n                #     even = (even * 2) % MOD\n                #     odd = (odd * 2) % MOD\n                # Because including or excluding the even number doesn't change the parity.\n                # For odd numbers:\n                #     new_even = (even + odd) % MOD\n                #     new_odd = (even + odd) % MOD\n                # Wait, no. Because when you include the odd number, it flips the parity. So, the new even count is the previous odd count (since adding the odd number to those gives even), and the new odd count is the previous even count (since adding the odd number to those gives odd). But also, each existing subsequence can choose to include or exclude the current number. So, the total is:\n                # new_even = even (exclude) + odd (include, which flips to even)\n                # new_odd = odd (exclude) + even (include, which flips to odd)\n                # Wait, that makes sense. So, for an odd number:\n                # new_even = even + odd\n                # new_odd = odd + even\n                # But that's the same as new_even = even + odd and new_odd = even + odd, which would make both even and odd equal to even + odd. That can't be right because it would mean that after processing an odd number, the counts are the same, which isn't correct.\n                # I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's look for a pattern or mathematical approach.\n                # Let's consider that the total number of subsequences is 2^n, where n is the length of the array. But we need only those with odd sum.\n                # The number of such subsequences can be calculated based on the count of odd numbers in the array.\n                # Let's denote the number of odd elements as k.\n                # If k is zero, there are no odd-sum subsequences.\n                # If k is at least one, the number of odd-sum subsequences is (2^(n-1)) if the sum of all elements is odd, but that's not necessarily the case.\n                # Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each odd number can be included or not, and the sum's parity depends on the number of odd numbers included.\n                # So, the total number of subsequences with odd sum is equal to the sum over all subsets of the array where the subset contains an odd number of odd elements.\n                # So, if there are k odd numbers in the array, the number of such subsets is (2^{k-1}) * (2^{m}), where m is the number of even numbers. Because for each even number, it can be included or not, and for the odd numbers, we need to choose an odd number of them. The number of ways to choose an odd number of k elements is 2^{k-1}.\n                # So, the formula is: if k == 0, 0. Else, (2^{k-1}) * (2^m) = 2^{k-1 + m} = 2^{n-1} if k >=1.\n                # Wait, that can't be right because in the first example, nums = [1,1,1], k=3, m=0. So 2^{3-1} * 2^0 = 4, which matches the example.\n                # In the second example, nums = [1,2,2], k=1, m=2. So 2^{1-1} * 2^2 = 1 *4=4, which matches the example.\n                # So, the general formula is: if there are zero odd numbers, return 0. Else, return (2^{n-1}) mod MOD.\n                # Wait, that's a much simpler approach. So, the number of subsequences with odd sum is 2^{n-1} if there is at least one odd number, else 0.\n                # Let's test this with some examples.\n                # Example 1: [1,1,1], n=3, k=3. 2^{2} =4. Correct.\n                # Example 2: [1,2,2], n=3, k=1. 2^{2}=4. Correct.\n                # Another test case: nums = [2,4,6], all even. Then, no odd sum subsequences. So output is 0.\n                # Another test case: nums = [3], output is 1 (only [3]).\n                # Another test case: nums = [3,5], n=2, k=2. 2^{1}=2. The possible subsequences are [3], [5], [3,5]. Sums are 3,5,8. Only two have odd sums. Correct.\n                # So, the solution is to count the number of odd elements in the array. If there are none, return 0. Otherwise, compute 2^{n-1} mod MOD.\n                # This approach is O(n) time and O(1) space, which is efficient for n up to 1e5.\n                # So, the code can be written as:\n                # count the number of odd elements in nums\n                # if count ==0: return 0\n                # else: return pow(2, len(nums)-1, MOD)\n                # But wait, what about when the array has both even and odd numbers? For example, nums = [1,2,3]. n=3, k=2. 2^{2}=4. Let's see:\n                # Subsequences:\n                # [], sum 0 (even)\n                # [1], 1 (odd)\n                # [2], 2 (even)\n                # [3], 3 (odd)\n                # [1,2], 3 (odd)\n                # [1,3],4 (even)\n                # [2,3],5 (odd)\n                # [1,2,3],6 (even)\n                # So, the odd sum subsequences are [1], [3], [1,2], [2,3]. Total 4, which is 2^{3-1}=4. Correct.\n                # So, the formula holds.\n                # Therefore, the solution is to count the number of odd elements. If zero, return 0. Else, return 2^{n-1} mod MOD.\n                # So, the code is straightforward.\n                # Now, let's implement this.\n                # Edge cases:\n                # - All even: return 0\n                # - All odd: return 2^{n-1}\n                # - Mix of even and odd: same as above\n                # So, the code can be written as:\n                count_odds = sum(1 for num in nums if num % 2 != 0)\n                if count_odds == 0:\n                    return 0\n                else:\n                    return pow(2, len(nums)-1, MOD)\n        # Wait, but in the initial approach, I thought of a dynamic programming approach, but this mathematical approach is much simpler and efficient.\n        # So, the correct code is as above.\n        # Let me adjust the code accordingly.\n        # So, the function becomes:\n        MOD = 10**9 +7\n        count_odds = sum(1 for num in nums if num %2 !=0)\n        if count_odds ==0:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            return pow(2, len(nums)-1, MOD)\n        # But wait, what about when the array is empty?
