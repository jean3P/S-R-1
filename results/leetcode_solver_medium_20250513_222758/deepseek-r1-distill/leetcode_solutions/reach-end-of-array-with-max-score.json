    "Wait, the code I provided doesn't seem to handle the jumps correctly. Let me think again. The problem allows jumping multiple steps, not just one. So my initial approach is wrong. I need to find a way to decide the optimal points to jump.\n\nHmm, perhaps a dynamic programming approach would work. Let's define dp[i] as the maximum score to reach index i. Then, for each i, we look back at all possible j < i and compute dp[i] = max(dp[j] + (i-j)*nums[j]). But this would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=1e5.\n\nThat's not efficient enough. I need a better approach. Maybe we can find a way to keep track of the maximum possible contribution as we iterate through the array.\n\nWait, another idea: since each jump's score is (j - i) * nums[i], the further we jump, the more we can gain if nums[i] is large. So perhaps, at each step, we should jump as far as possible when nums[i] is the maximum so far.\n\nWait, let's think about the example:\n\nExample 1: [1,3,1,5]\nThe optimal path is 0->1->3. The score is 1*1 + 2*3 = 7.\n\nIf we had jumped directly from 0 to 3, the score would be 3*1=3, which is worse.\n\nSo, the maximum nums[i] up to that point is important. So, perhaps, whenever we encounter a new maximum, we should consider jumping from there as much as possible.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal strategy is to jump from the current maximum as far as possible. So, we can keep track of the maximum value and the farthest we can reach from it.\n\nLet me try to model this:\n\nInitialize max_val = nums[0], max_index = 0, total_score = 0, current_position = 0.\n\nThen, for each position i from 0 to n-2:\n\n- If nums[i] > max_val, update max_val and max_index.\n- Once we can't go further, jump from max_index to the next possible position, adding (distance) * max_val to the score.\n\nWait, perhaps we can iterate through the array, keeping track of the maximum value up to the current point. Each time we decide to jump, we take the maximum possible step from the current maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum score is achieved by jumping from each position i to the next position j where nums[j] is larger than nums[i], but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the total score can be expressed as the sum over each i of (j - i) * nums[i], where j is the next jump from i. So, the total is sum_{i} (j - i) * nums[i].\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to jump as far as possible from the current maximum. So, whenever we find a new maximum, we should jump from there as far as possible.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Start at index 0. The current maximum is nums[0].\n2. Look ahead to find the farthest index where nums[i] is less than the current maximum. From the current maximum, jump to that farthest index, adding (distance) * current_max to the score.\n3. Update the current maximum to the maximum value in the new segment.\n4. Repeat until we reach the end.\n\nWait, but how do we efficiently find the farthest index where nums[i] is less than the current maximum? That might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process the array in segments where each segment is determined by the maximum value in that segment. Each time we process a segment, we calculate the contribution to the score.\n\nLet me think about this:\n\n- The first segment starts at 0. The maximum in this segment is nums[0]. The farthest we can go from here is the next index where nums[i] is greater than or equal to the current maximum. Wait, no, because if we have a higher value later, we might want to jump from there instead.\n\nHmm, maybe the correct approach is to greedily jump from the current maximum as far as possible. So, whenever we find a new maximum, we should consider jumping from there.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal path is to jump from each position i to the next position j where nums[j] is greater than nums[i]. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum score is achieved by jumping from each position i to the farthest possible j where nums[i] is the maximum in the range i to j.\n\nWait, let's think about the example:\n\nExample 1: [1,3,1,5]\n\nThe maximum at 0 is 1. The next maximum is 3 at index 1. So, we jump from 0 to 1, adding 1*1=1. Then, from 1, the maximum is 3. The next maximum is 5 at index 3. So, we jump from 1 to 3, adding 2*3=6. Total is 7.\n\nAnother example: [4,3,1,3,2]\n\nThe maximum at 0 is 4. The next maximum is 3 at index 1, which is less than 4. Then 1 is less, then 3 is less than 4, then 2 is less. So, the farthest we can jump from 0 is to the end, adding 4*4=16.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each position i, if nums[i] is the maximum so far, then we can jump from i to the next position where nums[j] is greater than nums[i], or to the end if there's no such j.\n\nWait, but how to implement this efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: the maximum score can be calculated by considering each position as a potential jump point, and for each, determine how far it can contribute to the total score.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum score is the sum of (distance) * nums[i] for each i, where the distance is the number of steps we jump from i.\n\nBut how to model the distances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding all the positions where nums[i] is a local maximum, and then calculate the contribution from each such position.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to jump from each position i to the next position j where nums[j] is greater than nums[i], and accumulate the score as (j - i) * nums[i]. If there is no such j, then jump to the end.\n\nBut how to find these j's efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each i the farthest j where nums[j] is the next greater element. But that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a greedy approach, keeping track of the maximum value and the current position, and whenever a new maximum is found, we calculate the contribution from the previous maximum to the current position.\n\nWait, let's try to outline this approach:\n\nInitialize:\n\n- max_val = nums[0]\n- current_max = max_val\n- total_score = 0\n- start = 0\n\nIterate from i = 1 to len(nums)-1:\n\n- If nums[i] > current_max:\n   - The distance from start to i-1 is (i - start)\n   - Add (i - start) * current_max to total_score\n   - Update current_max to nums[i]\n   - Update start to i\n\nAfter the loop, add the remaining distance from start to end (len(nums)-1 - start) multiplied by current_max.\n\nWait, let's test this with example 1:\n\nnums = [1,3,1,5]\n\ni=1: nums[1]=3 > current_max=1. So, distance is 1-0=1. Add 1*1=1. current_max=3, start=1.\n\ni=2: nums[2]=1 < current_max=3. Do nothing.\n\ni=3: nums[3]=5 > current_max=3. Distance is 3-1=2. Add 2*3=6. current_max=5, start=3.\n\nAfter loop, add (3 to 3) distance is 0, so nothing.\n\nTotal is 1+6=7. Correct.\n\nExample 2: [4,3,1,3,2]\n\ni=1: 3 <4. Do nothing.\n\ni=2:1 <4. Do nothing.\n\ni=3:3 <4. Do nothing.\n\ni=4:2 <4. Do nothing.\n\nAfter loop, add (4-0)*4=4*4=16. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: [2,1,3,4]\n\ni=0: max is 2.\n\ni=1:1 <2.\n\ni=2:3>2. So, distance 2-0=2. Add 2*2=4. current_max=3, start=2.\n\ni=3:4>3. Distance 3-2=1. Add 1*3=3. current_max=4, start=3.\n\nAfter loop, add (3 to 3) nothing.\n\nTotal is 4+3=7.\n\nBut what's the optimal path? Let's see:\n\nPossible paths:\n\n0->1->2->3: score is 1*2 +1*1 +1*3=2+1+3=6.\n\n0->2->3: score is 2*2 +1*3=4+3=7.\n\n0->3: score is 3*2=6.\n\nSo the approach gives 7, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [3,2,1,4]\n\ni=0: max=3.\n\ni=1:2<3.\n\ni=2:1<3.\n\ni=3:4>3. Distance 3-0=3. Add 3*3=9. current_max=4, start=3.\n\nAfter loop, add (3 to 3) nothing.\n\nTotal is 9.\n\nOptimal path: 0->3. Score is 3*3=9. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: [5,4,3,2,1]\n\ni=0: max=5.\n\ni=1:4<5.\n\ni=2:3<5.\n\ni=3:2<5.\n\ni=4:1<5.\n\nAfter loop, add (4-0)*5=4*5=20.\n\nWhich is correct, as jumping directly from 0 to 4 gives 4*5=20.\n\nSo, this approach seems to work.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- Keep track of the current maximum value and the starting index.\n\n- For each i from 1 to n-1:\n\n   - If nums[i] > current_max:\n\n      - Calculate the distance from start to i-1, add to total.\n\n      - Update current_max to nums[i], start to i.\n\n- After the loop, add the distance from start to end (n-1 - start) multiplied by current_max.\n\nThis way, each time we find a new maximum, we calculate the contribution from the previous maximum's segment.\n\nThis approach is O(n) time and O(1) space, which is efficient for n=1e5.\n\nSo, the code should implement this logic.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\nInitialize:\n\nmax_score = 0\n\ncurrent_max = nums[0]\n\nstart = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, len(nums)):\n\n   if nums[i] > current_max:\n\n       distance = i - start\n\n       max_score += distance * current_max\n\n       current_max = nums[i]\n\n       start = i\n\nAfter loop:\n\ndistance = len(nums) - 1 - start\n\nmax_score += distance * current_max\n\nReturn max_score.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting with example 1:\n\nnums = [1,3,1,5]\n\ni=1: 3>1. distance=1-0=1. max_score=1*1=1. current_max=3, start=1.\n\ni=2:1<3. no change.\n\ni=3:5>3. distance=3-1=2. max_score += 2*3=6. total 7. current_max=5, start=3.\n\nAfter loop: distance=3 to 3 is 0. total remains 7.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: [2,1,3,4]\n\ni=1:1<2.\n\ni=2:3>2. distance=2-0=2. add 2*2=4. current_max=3, start=2.\n\ni=3:4>3. distance=3-2=1. add 1*3=3. total 7.\n\nAfter loop: distance=3 to 3 is 0.\n\nTotal 7.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: [3,2,1,4]\n\ni=1:2<3.\n\ni=2:1<3.\n\ni=3:4>3. distance=3-0=3. add 3*3=9. current_max=4, start=3.\n\nAfter loop: distance=3 to 3 is 0.\n\nTotal 9.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: [5,4,3,2,1]\n\ni=1:4<5.\n\ni=2:3<5.\n\ni=3:2<5.\n\ni=4:1<5.\n\nAfter loop: distance=4-0=4. add 4*5=20.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: [2,3,1,4]\n\ni=1:3>2. distance=1-0=1. add 1*2=2. current_max=3, start=1.\n\ni=2:1<3.\n\ni=3:4>3. distance=3-1=2. add 2*3=6. total 8.\n\nAfter loop: distance=3 to 3 is 0.\n\nTotal 8.\n\nOptimal path: 0->1->3. Score is 1*2 + 2*3=2+6=8.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases correctly.\n</think>\n\n## Problem Analysis\nThe problem requires finding the maximum possible score when jumping from the start to the end of an array. Each jump's score is determined by the distance jumped multiplied by the value at the starting index. The goal is to maximize the total score by making optimal jumps.\n\n## Solution Approach\nThe optimal strategy involves a greedy approach where we keep track of the maximum value encountered so far and use it to decide the next jump. By iterating through the array and updating the maximum value whenever a larger value is found, we can efficiently calculate the maximum score. Each time a new maximum is encountered, we calculate the contribution of the previous segment to the total score and update our current position and maximum value.\n\n## Code Solution",

      "solution": "Wait, the code I provided doesn't seem to handle the jumps correctly. Let me think again. The problem allows jumping multiple steps, not just one. So my initial approach is wrong. I need to find a way to decide the optimal points to jump.\n\nHmm, perhaps a dynamic programming approach would work. Let's define dp[i] as the maximum score to reach index i. Then, for each i, we look back at all possible j < i and compute dp[i] = max(dp[j] + (i-j)*nums[j]). But this would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=1e5.\n\nThat's not efficient enough. I need a better approach. Maybe we can find a way to keep track of the maximum possible contribution as we iterate through the array.\n\nWait, another idea: since each jump's score is (j - i) * nums[i], the further we jump, the more we can gain if nums[i] is large. So perhaps, at each step, we should jump as far as possible when nums[i] is the maximum so far.\n\nWait, let's think about the example:\n\nExample 1: [1,3,1,5]\nThe optimal path is 0->1->3. The score is 1*1 + 2*3 = 7.\n\nIf we had jumped directly from 0 to 3, the score would be 3*1=3, which is worse.\n\nSo, the maximum nums[i] up to that point is important. So, perhaps, whenever we encounter a new maximum, we should consider jumping from there as much as possible.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal strategy is to jump from the current maximum as far as possible. So, we can keep track of the maximum value and the farthest we can reach from it.\n\nLet me try to model this:\n\nInitialize max_val = nums[0], max_index = 0, total_score = 0, current_position = 0.\n\nThen, for each position i from 0 to n-2:\n\n- If nums[i] > max_val, update max_val and max_index.\n- Once we can't go further, jump from max_index to the next possible position, adding (distance) * max_val to the score.\n\nWait, perhaps we can iterate through the array, keeping track of the maximum value up to the current point. Each time we decide to jump, we take the maximum possible step from the current maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum score is achieved by jumping from each position i to the next position j where nums[j] is larger than nums[i], but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the total score can be expressed as the sum over each i of (j - i) * nums[i], where j is the next jump from i. So, the total is sum_{i} (j - i) * nums[i].\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to jump as far as possible from the current maximum. So, whenever we find a new maximum, we should jump from there as far as possible.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Start at index 0. The current maximum is nums[0].\n2. Look ahead to find the farthest index where nums[i] is less than the current maximum. From the current maximum, jump to that farthest index, adding (distance) * current_max to the score.\n3. Update the current maximum to the maximum value in the new segment.\n4. Repeat until we reach the end.\n\nWait, but how do we efficiently find the farthest index where nums[i] is less than the current maximum? That might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process the array in segments where each segment is determined by the maximum value in that segment. Each time we process a segment, we calculate the contribution to the score.\n\nLet me think about this:\n\n- The first segment starts at 0. The maximum in this segment is nums[0]. The farthest we can go from here is the next index where nums[i] is greater than or equal to the current maximum. Wait, no, because if we have a higher value later, we might want to jump from there instead.\n\nHmm, maybe the correct approach is to greedily jump from the current maximum as far as possible. So, whenever we find a new maximum, we should consider jumping from there.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal path is to jump from each position i to the next position j where nums[j] is greater than nums[i]. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum score is achieved by jumping from each position i to the farthest possible j where nums[i] is the maximum in the range i to j.\n\nWait, let's think about the example:\n\nExample 1: [1,3,1,5]\n\nThe maximum at 0 is 1. The next maximum is 3 at index 1. So, we jump from 0 to 1, adding 1*1=1. Then, from 1, the maximum is 3. The next maximum is 5 at index 3. So, we jump from 1 to 3, adding 2*3=6. Total is 7.\n\nAnother example: [4,3,1,3,2]\n\nThe maximum at 0 is 4. The next maximum is 3 at index 1, which is less than 4. Then 1 is less, then 3 is less than 4, then 2 is less. So, the farthest we can jump from 0 is to the end, adding 4*4=16.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each position i, if nums[i] is the maximum so far, then we can jump from i to the next position where nums[j] is greater than nums[i], or to the end if there's no such j.\n\nWait, but how to implement this efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: the maximum score can be calculated by considering each position as a potential jump point, and for each, determine how far it can contribute to the total score.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum score is the sum of (distance) * nums[i] for each i, where the distance is the number of steps we jump from i.\n\nBut how to model the distances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding all the positions where nums[i] is a local maximum, and then calculate the contribution from each such position.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to jump from each position i to the next position j where nums[j] is greater than nums[i], and accumulate the score as (j - i) * nums[i]. If there is no such j, then jump to the end.\n\nBut how to find these j's efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each i the farthest j where nums[j] is the next greater element. But that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a greedy approach, keeping track of the maximum value and the current position, and whenever a new maximum is found, we calculate the contribution from the previous maximum to the current position.\n\nWait, let's try to outline this approach:\n\nInitialize:\n\n- max_val = nums[0]\n- current_max = max_val\n- total_score = 0\n- start = 0\n\nIterate from i = 1 to len(nums)-1:\n\n- If nums[i] > current_max:\n   - The distance from start to i-1 is (i - start)\n   - Add (i - start) * current_max to total_score\n   - Update current_max to nums[i]\n   - Update start to i\n\nAfter the loop, add the remaining distance from start to end (len(nums)-1 - start) multiplied by current_max.\n\nWait, let's test this with example 1:\n\nnums = [1,3,1,5]\n\ni=1: nums[1]=3 > current_max=1. So, distance is 1-0=1. Add 1*1=1. current_max=3, start=1.\n\ni=2: nums[2]=1 < current_max=3. Do nothing.\n\ni=3: nums[3]=5 > current_max=3. Distance is 3-1=2. Add 2*3=6. current_max=5, start=3.\n\nAfter loop, add (3 to 3) distance is 0, so nothing.\n\nTotal is 1+6=7. Correct.\n\nExample 2: [4,3,1,3,2]\n\ni=1: 3 <4. Do nothing.\n\ni=2:1 <4. Do nothing.\n\ni=3:3 <4. Do nothing.\n\ni=4:2 <4. Do nothing.\n\nAfter loop, add (4-0)*4=4*4=16. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: [2,1,3,4]\n\ni=0: max is 2.\n\ni=1:1 <2.\n\ni=2:3>2. So, distance 2-0=2. Add 2*2=4. current_max=3, start=2.\n\ni=3:4>3. Distance 3-2=1. Add 1*3=3. current_max=4, start=3.\n\nAfter loop, add (3 to 3) nothing.\n\nTotal is 4+3=7.\n\nBut what's the optimal path? Let's see:\n\nPossible paths:\n\n0->1->2->3: score is 1*2 +1*1 +1*3=2+1+3=6.\n\n0->2->3: score is 2*2 +1*3=4+3=7.\n\n0->3: score is 3*2=6.\n\nSo the approach gives 7, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [3,2,1,4]\n\ni=0: max=3.\n\ni=1:2<3.\n\ni=2:1<3.\n\ni=3:4>3. Distance 3-0=3. Add 3*3=9. current_max=4, start=3.\n\nAfter loop, add (3 to 3) nothing.\n\nTotal is 9.\n\nOptimal path: 0->3. Score is 3*3=9. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: [5,4,3,2,1]\n\ni=0: max=5.\n\ni=1:4<5.\n\ni=2:3<5.\n\ni=3:2<5.\n\ni=4:1<5.\n\nAfter loop, add (4-0)*5=4*5=20.\n\nWhich is correct, as jumping directly from 0 to 4 gives 4*5=20.\n\nSo, this approach seems to work.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- Keep track of the current maximum value and the starting index.\n\n- For each i from 1 to n-1:\n\n   - If nums[i] > current_max:\n\n      - Calculate the distance from start to i-1, add to total.\n\n      - Update current_max to nums[i], start to i.\n\n- After the loop, add the distance from start to end (n-1 - start) multiplied by current_max.\n\nThis way, each time we find a new maximum, we calculate the contribution from the previous maximum's segment.\n\nThis approach is O(n) time and O(1) space, which is efficient for n=1e5.\n\nSo, the code should implement this logic.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n\nInitialize:\n\nmax_score = 0\n\ncurrent_max = nums[0]\n\nstart = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, len(nums)):\n\n   if nums[i] > current_max:\n\n       distance = i - start\n\n       max_score += distance * current_max\n\n       current_max = nums[i]\n\n       start = i\n\nAfter loop:\n\ndistance = len(nums) - 1 - start\n\nmax_score += distance * current_max\n\nReturn max_score.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nTesting with example 1:\n\nnums = [1,3,1,5]\n\ni=1: 3>1. distance=1-0=1. max_score=1*1=1. current_max=3, start=1.\n\ni=2:1<3. no change.\n\ni=3:5>3. distance=3-1=2. max_score += 2*3=6. total 7. current_max=5, start=3.\n\nAfter loop: distance=3 to 3 is 0. total remains 7.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: [2,1,3,4]\n\ni=1:1<2.\n\ni=2:3>2. distance=2-0=2. add 2*2=4. current_max=3, start=2.\n\ni=3:4>3. distance=3-2=1. add 1*3=3. total 7.\n\nAfter loop: distance=3 to 3 is 0.\n\nTotal 7.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: [3,2,1,4]\n\ni=1:2<3.\n\ni=2:1<3.\n\ni=3:4>3. distance=3-0=3. add 3*3=9. current_max=4, start=3.\n\nAfter loop: distance=3 to 3 is 0.\n\nTotal 9.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: [5,4,3,2,1]\n\ni=1:4<5.\n\ni=2:3<5.\n\ni=3:2<5.\n\ni=4:1<5.\n\nAfter loop: distance=4-0=4. add 4*5=20.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: [2,3,1,4]\n\ni=1:3>2. distance=1-0=1. add 1*2=2. current_max=3, start=1.\n\ni=2:1<3.\n\ni=3:4>3. distance=3-1=2. add 2*3=6. total 8.\n\nAfter loop: distance=3 to 3 is 0.\n\nTotal 8.\n\nOptimal path: 0->1->3. Score is 1*2 + 2*3=2+6=8.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases correctly.\n</think>\n\n## Problem Analysis\nThe problem requires finding the maximum possible score when jumping from the start to the end of an array. Each jump's score is determined by the distance jumped multiplied by the value at the starting index. The goal is to maximize the total score by making optimal jumps.\n\n## Solution Approach\nThe optimal strategy involves a greedy approach where we keep track of the maximum value encountered so far and use it to decide the next jump. By iterating through the array and updating the maximum value whenever a larger value is found, we can efficiently calculate the maximum score. Each time a new maximum is encountered, we calculate the contribution of the previous segment to the total score and update our current position and maximum value.\n\n## Code Solution",
