A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The function should efficiently handle both small and large numbers while also correctly managing edge cases such as negative numbers, zero, and one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Handle Edge Cases**: Immediately return `False` for any input less than or equal to 1, including negative numbers, zero, and one.\n2. **Check for Even Numbers**: If the number is even and greater than 2, it cannot be prime, so return `False`.\n3. **Efficient Prime Checking**: For odd numbers greater than 2, check divisibility up to the square root of the number. This reduces the number of checks needed compared to checking all numbers up to `n`.\n4. **Optimized Loop**: Iterate through potential divisors starting from 3, incrementing by 2 each time (to skip even numbers), up to the square root of `n`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we minimize unnecessary computations, making the function efficient even for larger values of `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a given integer n is a prime number.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        n (int): The integer to check for primality.\n        \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if n is a prime number, False otherwise.\n        \n    Examples:\n        >>> is_prime(7)\n        True\n        >>> is_prime(10)\n        False\n        >>> is_prime(1)\n        False\n        >>> is_prime(0)\n        False\n        >>> is_prime(-5)\n        False\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle edge cases\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Only check for factors up to sqrt(n)\n    max_divisor = int(n**0.5) + 1\n    for d in range(3, max_divisor, 2):\n        if n % d == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Edge Case Handling**: The function quickly returns `False` for non-prime candidates like negative numbers, zero, and one.\n- **Even Number Check**: By immediately returning `False` for even numbers greater than 2,",

If none divide n, then it's a prime—return True.\n\nWait, but calculating the square root might include non-integer values. Should I take the floor or ceiling? Hmm, using int(n ** 0.5) gives the integer part, so adding 1 ensures we cover all possible divisors up to sqrt(n).\n\nLet me test this logic with some examples.\n\nTest case 1: n=7.\nSteps:\n- 7 > 1 → proceed.\n- Not 2 → continue.\n- 7 is odd → proceed.\n- Max divisor is sqrt(7) ≈ 2.645, so int is 2, plus 1 makes 3.\n- Loop starts at 3, goes up to 3 (since step is 2, next would be 5 which is beyond).\n- Divisor\n\n# Execution Output:\nNo output\n\n# Execution Errors:\n  File \"/scratch/local/17232188/tmp_6mkjm9t.py\", line 1\n    Okay, I need to determine if a given integer is a prime number.

            "solution": "Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_prime that determines whether a given integer is a prime number. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, what's a prime number? A prime is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, my function should return True if the input is a prime and False otherwise.\n\nLet me consider some edge cases. If the input is less than or equal to 1, it's definitely not prime. So, I'll handle that first. Also, 2 is the smallest prime number, so if the input is exactly 2, I should return True. What about even numbers greater than 2? They can't be primes because they're divisible by 2. So, any even number beyond 2 should immediately return False.\n\nNow, for odd numbers greater than 2. How do I check if they're prime efficiently? Checking all possible divisors up to n would be too slow, especially for large numbers. Instead, I remember that I only need to check up to the square root of n. Because if n has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding divisor would be smaller than the square root, which we would have already checked.\n\nSo, the plan is: after handling the small cases, calculate the maximum divisor as the square root of n plus one. Then, loop through all odd numbers starting from 3 up to this maximum, checking if any divide n evenly. If any do, return False; otherwise, return True.\n\nWait, why start at 3 and increment by 2 each time? Oh right, because even divisors are already ruled out since n is odd now. So, checking only odd divisors skips half the potential checks, making the function more efficient.\n\nPutting it all together, here's the structure of the function:\n\n- Check if n is less than or equal to 1: return False.\n- Check if n is 2: return True.\n- Check if n is even: return False.\n- Calculate the maximum divisor as sqrt(n) + 1.\n- Loop from 3 to max_divisor, stepping by 2 each time.\n- For each divisor, if n mod divisor is zero, return False.\n- After the loop, return True.\n\nI should also make sure the function handles negative inputs correctly. For example, -3 is less than 2 but still returns False, which aligns with our initial condition.\n\nTesting some examples",
