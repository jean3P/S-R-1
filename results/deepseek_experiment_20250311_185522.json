A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The function should efficiently handle large numbers and correctly process edge cases such as negative numbers, zero, and one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Handle Edge Cases**: Immediately return `False` for any input less than or equal to 1, as these cannot be prime numbers.\n2. **Check for Small Primes**: If the input is 2 or 3, return `True` since they are the smallest primes.\n3. **Eliminate Even Numbers**: If the input is even and greater than 2, it cannot be prime, so return `False`.\n4. **Efficient Prime Checking**: For larger numbers, check divisibility up to the square root of \\( n \\). This reduces the number of checks needed compared to checking all numbers up to \\( n \\).\n   - Check divisibility by odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of \\( n \\), incrementing by 2 each time to skip even numbers.\n5. **Return Result**: If no divisors are found, return `True`, indicating \\( n \\) is prime.\n\nThis approach ensures efficiency, especially for large numbers, by minimizing the number of necessary checks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine if a given integer n is a prime number.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        n (int): The integer to check for primality.\n        \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if n is a prime number, False otherwise.\n        \n    Examples:\n        >>> is_prime(7)\n        True\n        >>> is_prime(10)\n        False\n        >>> is_prime(1)\n        False\n        >>> is_prime(0)\n        False\n        >>> is_prime(-5)\n        False\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be an integer.\")\n    \n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    elif n <= 3:\n        return True\n    elif n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    max_divisor = int(n ** 0.5) + 1\n    for d in range(3, max_divisor, 2):\n        if n % d == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n-",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, what's a prime number? Oh right, a prime is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, if n is less than or equal to 1, it's definitely not prime. That's an easy first check.\n\nWait, but what about negative numbers? Like, someone might pass -5 into the function. Well, according to the definition, primes are positive integers greater than 1, so any number less than 2 should return False. Got it.\n\nWhat about even numbers? Well, except for 2, all even numbers are not prime because they're divisible by 2. So maybe after handling the initial checks, I can quickly eliminate even numbers by seeing if n mod 2 equals zero.\n\nSimilarly, numbers divisible by 3 aren't prime either, unless the number is 3 itself. So perhaps I can add a check for divisibility by 3 as well.\n\nBut wait, checking every possible divisor up to n would be inefficient, especially for large numbers. There's a smarter way—checking up to the square root of n. Because if n has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding factor would be smaller than the square root, so we'd have already found it.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1.

Your task is to write efficient, readable, and well-documented code.\n\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function called is_prime that determines whether a given integer n is a prime number. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, what's a prime number? Oh right, a prime is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, if n is less than or equal to 1, it's definitely not prime. That's an easy first check.\n\nWait, but what about negative numbers? Like, someone might pass -5 into the function. Well, according to the definition, primes are positive integers greater than 1, so any number less than 2 should return False. Got it.\n\nWhat about even numbers? Well, except for 2, all even numbers are not prime because they're divisible by 2. So maybe after handling the initial checks, I can quickly eliminate even numbers by seeing if n mod 2 equals zero.\n\nSimilarly, numbers divisible by 3 aren't prime either, unless the number is 3 itself. So perhaps I can add a check for divisibility by 3 as well.\n\nBut wait, checking every possible divisor up to n would be inefficient, especially for large numbers. There's a smarter way—checking up to the square root of n. Because if n has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding factor would be smaller than the square root, so we'd have already found it.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Check if n is an integer. If not, raise a TypeError. Wait, does the problem require that? Looking back at the task, yes, the original solution had a type check. So I should include that.\n\n2. Handle edge cases where n is less than or equal to 1, returning False immediately.\n\n3. Return True if n is 2 or 3 since those are primes.\n\n4. For numbers greater than 3, check if they're even or divisible by 3. If yes, return False.\n\n5. Now, for the main part: iterate from 5 upwards, checking divisors of the form 6k ± 1. Why? Because all primes greater than 3 can be written in the form 6k ± 1. So this allows us to skip checking multiples of 2 and 3, making the algorithm more efficient.\n\n6. In each iteration, check if i divides n. If it does, return False. Otherwise, increment i by 2 or 4 alternately\n\n# Execution Output:\nNo output\n\n# Execution Errors:\n  File \"/scratch/local/17228145/tmphtlbq69q.py\", line 1\n    Okay, so I need to write a Python function called is_prime that determines whether a given integer n is a prime number.
